# Contributing to the Digital Skills GitBook

The Digital Skills GitBook is an open source project and like many projects on GitHub we welcome your contributions. 

If you have knowledge or expertise on one of our [requested topics](https://aarnet.gitbook.io/digital-skills-gitbook-1/requested-articles), we would love you to write an article for the book. Please let us know what you'd like to write about via our [contributor form](https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook/issues/new?assignees=sarasrking&labels=contributors&template=contributor-form.yml&title=Contributor+form%3A+).

There are other ways to contribute too. For example, you might:

* have a great idea for a new topic to be included in one of our chapters \(make a new page\)
* notice some information that’s out-of-date or that could be explained better \(edit a page\)
* come across something in the GitBook that’s not working as it should be \(submit an issue\)

By working through this topic, you’ll learn how to:

* set up your own GitHub repository
* contribute to an open source project on GitHub, and
* submit a bug 

## Setting up and becoming familiar with your GitHub repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and follow the prompts to Sign up. You will need e-mail address, and you will be asked to create a username and password. You will have to solve a ‘puzzle’ before a Launch code will be sent to your e-mail address.
2. Click on the button to Start a project.
3. Give your new [repository](https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook/blob/master/glossary.md#repository) a name. Your repository’s URL will take the form:

   [https://github.com/your](https://github.com/your) user name/your repository name

   Spaces in repository names will be replaced with hyphens, ie, your-repository-name.


## Adding a new topic to the Digital Skills GitBook via GitHub

Before you start, please familiarise yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://app.gitbook.com/@aarnet/s/digital-skills-gitbook-1/code-of-conduct), Instructions for Contributors and Style Guide.

1. First, please fill out [our contributor form](https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook/issues/new?assignees=sarasrking&labels=contributors&template=contributor-form.yml&title=Contributor+form%3A+) \(make sure you’re still signed in to GitHub\) so that we can credit you for your work! If you’d like to leave it there, you can submit your content via the form and we’ll add it to the GitBook on your behalf. But we really hope you try submitting via a GitHub pull request as this project is all about learning new things!
2. Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook](https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook)
3. In the top right-hand corner of the page, select Fork. By ‘forking’ the repository, you’re creating a copy of our code and editing it in your own account. You can’t break the Digital Skills GitBook or make any unintended changes by doing this.
4. You are now working in the cloned version of the repository you have just created. The folders match the chapter headings in the GitBook. Open the relevant folder.
5. Select Add File &gt; Create new file. Use the format xxxx.md to create a Markdown file.
6. This file will be a new page in the GitBook. Now, add your content using Markdown to format your headings and links. You don’t need to spend hours learning code to be able to contribute! Most pages in the GitBook will only use some basics:

   Headings – use \# to indicate your main heading

   Bold – add two asterisks before and after your word or phrase

   Hyperlinking - \[Text to be linked\]\(URL\)

7. Commit your changes directly to the master branch.
8. Then open SUMMARY.md and select Edit this file. This file is the GitBook’s Table of Contents. Add your page by copying the existing format and structure.
9. Commit your changes directly to the master branch.
10. Now you will need to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AARNet/Digital-Skills-GitBook/blob/master/glossary.md#pullrequest) to notify the project team. Click on the Pull requests heading and start a New pull request.
11. Ensure the base repository is AARNET/Digital-Skills-GitBook and head repository is your forked repository. Then click on Create pull request.
12. You will need to add a Title for your pull request. You will also need to leave a comment. This can be a short description of the changes you have made. Then click on Create pull request to finalise the request.
