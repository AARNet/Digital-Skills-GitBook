# Using password managers

## Overview 
To effectively work, study and live in a digitally-connected world we regularly need to use platforms and software that require password-protected logins. The proliferation of these logins raises two important issues for passwords:
* The reuse of passwords across logins for different platforms
* The use of insufficiently complex passwords that are therefore vulnerable to unauthorised access

Password management software aims to overcome both of these problems by **creating complex passwords** and **storing login details**. This means you no longer need to think of (and remember) multiple passwords, you just need to remember the password for your password manager and then use it when you come to login to a particular platform. 

In short, the benefits of using password managers include:
* No longer having to remember which password goes with which login
* Greater security through the use of complex passwords which are hard to guess and resistant to ‘brute force’ hacking attempts
* Time savings through the use of password manager’s automatic or copy and paste password filling capabilities 
* Being able to access all your passwords via one strong master password that you decide for yourself

Sounds simple, right? Well, with a *little* bit of work, you can have a password manager set up and running across **multiple devices**, keeping your passwords for your personal and professional life at hand as you need them. 

This short, entertaining video from ABC TV’s The Checkout explains more about why password managers are such a **great idea**.

There are many different password management software options available, including:
*	[LastPass]([url](https://www.lastpass.com/))
*	[1Password]([url](https://1password.com/))
*	[BitWarden]([url](https://bitwarden.com/))
* [KeePass]([url](https://keepass.info/))

Devices from Apple (via [iCloud Keychain]([url](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204085))) and Google (via [Password Manager]([url](https://passwords.google.com/))) come with password management options as well.

Alternatively, [this video from Deakin University Library provides an explanation and demonstration of LastPass]([url](https://video.deakin.edu.au/media/t/0_7p844h8y/)), although we are not necessarily recommending LastPass over any of the other options.

The main thing to remember is that using a password manager will keep your important personal login details **more secure** while **making your life easier**. While there is a time investment in transitioning to a password manager, it is **well worth the cost** for the peace of mind and convenience.
