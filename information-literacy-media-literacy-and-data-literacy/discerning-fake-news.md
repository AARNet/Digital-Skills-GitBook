# Discerning fake news

## Overview

This article will cover:

* Spotting misinformation and fake news
* Lateral reading
* Filter bubbles
* Deep fakes

## Getting started

**Fake news** involves hoaxes, opinions, scams, or misleading or false information presented as legitimate news stories. It is capable of disrupting elections, economies, social movements, reputations, geo-political conflicts and more. While some fake news may appear fake, others are increasingly more sophisticated.

Confirmation bias – fake news confirms existing beliefs

Common features of fake news include:

* Provocative or misleading headlines
* Clickbait
* Propaganda

However, you should always check for the following:

### Authority

* Is the author qualified to be writing on this topic? Do they possess relevant qualifications or work experience?
* If the author is an organisation, is it recognised and trustworthy?
* Is there an ulterior motive for presenting the information, particularly a financial or political one?

### Purpose

* Why was the content created? 
* Is its goal to inform \(presenting an objective and evidence-based account of the topic\)?
* Is its goal to persuade \(presenting a biased or one-sided account of the topic\)?
* Is the information trying to sell you a product?

### Evidence

* If claims are being made, is there evidence to support them, either as references or links to further information?
* If the author is using references, are they from authors who are qualified to write on the topic?
* Can you find corroboration for the points being made elsewhere on the internet?

The best way to establish the credibility of information is through a process called **lateral reading**. The process of lateral reading involves reading across sources, checking information as it’s presented to you. This includes searching for more information about the author or organisation who created the information,

## Proficient

**Filter bubbles** are echo chambers of like-minded people, curated through the personalisation of online services \(including news, search results, and social media algorithms\). Filter bubbles affect the flow of information that you receive, reducing or preventing exposure to information that may challenge our world view.

Filter bubbles play a large part in online communities where false news can easily spread. Impacts on Brexit and Trump.

social media algorithms, tracked user behaviour, and personal choice \(through muting, unfriending, or blocking those who you don’t want to see\).

### How to ‘pop’ your filter bubble.

* Turn off customisation features
* Turn off targeted ads

## Advanced

**Deep fakes** are a sophisticated form of fake news, where fictional videos or images are created featuring well-known or made-up people doing or saying things that are not real. This advanced form of manipulation is created using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### How to spot deep fakes

* Search for surrounding media or do a reverse image search of a video screenshot
* Unnatural eye movement or facial expressions
* A lack of emotion
* Awkward-looking body or posture
* Poor lip-syncing
* Fine details, such as hair or teeth
