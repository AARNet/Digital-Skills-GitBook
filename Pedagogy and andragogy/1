# Pedagogy and andragogy (adult learning) in an online environment
Creating content for adult learners? Check out the [Learner Variability Navigator](https://lvp.digitalpromiseglobal.org/). You can
create your own account and start a free workspace!
Want to increase adult learners’ motivation? Check out this advice from Saunders & Wong
(2020):
1. Emphasise the relevance of the content.
2. Make the content appropriately challenging.
3. Give learners a sense of choice and control (e.g. options in types of activities and
assignments, or in research topics).
4. Set learners up for success by setting clear expectations for class or assignment.
5. Guide self-assessment so that learners can make reasonable predictions of the likelihood
of their success.
Use low-stakes pre-assessments to find out your learners’ level of knowledge/ability, to
preview content, and to find out how to connect new knowledge with what they know
already.
