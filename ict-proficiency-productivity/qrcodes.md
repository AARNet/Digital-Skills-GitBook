# Using QR codes

## Developing
The QR in ‘QR code’ stands for ‘Quick Response’. 
QR codes are square barcodes that enable people to use their device to scan the image for quick access to a URL on the spot without having to type the full URL out. QR codes are popular on marketing posters and other print collateral where you may wish to direct people to more information than can fit on the poster or handout.

### Using a QR code

Most modern smartphones have a QR code scanner built into their camera app so you won’t need to install any additional apps to start using QR codes. The steps for reading a QR code may differ slightly between models.  

•	Examine the poster the QR code is on, in case [a fradulent QR code has been stuck over a legitimate one](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/qr-code-scams-are-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-avoid-getting-duped/).

•	Ensure your device has an internet connection. 

•	Open your Camera app.

•	Using the rear camera, hold your device up to the code. Don’t take a photo, just let it focus on the code. You will need to hold your device quite still. 

**Tip for iPhone/iPad users:** If it’s not working, check the Settings on your device. Scroll down to the Camera settings and ensure ‘Scan QR codes’ is enabled. 
**Tip for android users:** You can also use the Google Lens tool to scan QR codes on an Android device.

### Creating a QR code
There are a number of free, online QR code generators available. Some options include: 

•	[QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)

•	[Beaconstac](https://www.beaconstac.com/)

•	[Q Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)

They all work in a similar manner in that you can simply copy and paste your URL into the webpage and it generates the QR code. Each of these tools enables you to customise the size of your QR code and other settings. 

**Tip:** Think carefully about the size of your QR code. A code that’s too small will likely be too small for smartphone cameras to focus on. Be aware that reflection can impact on readability of the QR code.

QR codes can also be generated on devices by downloading the Google Chrome app and opening the URL you wish to use. On an iPhone, click the share icon in the search bar and ‘Create a QR code’. You can then download the QR code or send it to someone else. On an Android phone, click the three dots on the toolbar and click Share.
