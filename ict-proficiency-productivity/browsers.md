# Installing and accessing browsers

## Overview 

Internet or web browsers are programs that you can use to navigate to and view content that exists on the internet. Where the internet is a network of digital webpages and content sitting in a database in a far away physical location, the browser is the interface that you, the user, will be using to display and access those webpages on your own computer.

### What browser should I pick?

There are various types of browsers out there. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what type of computer operating system you have and what you might prefer in functionality, or if you are just picking on looks there are a many choices out there. 

Some of the more popular browers that you will encounter are:
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) 
  - Note: Only compatible with Apple devices
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Note: Already installed on new Windows computers and devices

Some considerations that you should make when choosing your browser would be:
- What operating system do you have on your computer? 
  - Safari usually comes with an Apple computer where Microsoft Edge is provided with Windows. 
  - However all browsers are compatible with all systems. Just be sure to download the right version for your device.
- Have you already set up an account with Google, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, or Apple? 
  -  Each browser allows you to set up an account so that you can sync your browsing history and settings across multiple devices. 
  -  For example: if you are part of the Google Space you might consider Google Chrome as that will allow you to use your account to sync with your phone and access documents and services run through Google. 
-  Are you concerned about website tracking?
    -  Some browsers like Firefox have additional settings included that focus more on privacy and security. 
   -  Other browsers like Google Chrome may focus more on personalisation and customisation of content based on your interactions.
