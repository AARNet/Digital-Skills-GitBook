Where the internet is a network of digital webpages and content sitting in a database in a far away physical location, the browser is the interface that you, the user, will be using to display and access those webpages on your own computer.

## Getting started

### What browser should I pick?

There are various types of browsers out there. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what type of computer operating system you have and what you might prefer in functionality, or if you are just picking on looks, there are a many choices out there. One of these will already come with whatever device that you have purchased.

Some of the more popular browers that you will encounter are:
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) 
  - Note: Only compatible with Apple devices, pre-installed on most Apple products. 
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Note: Already installed on new Windows computers and devices

Some considerations that you should make when choosing your browser would be:
- What operating system do you have on your computer? 
  - Safari usually comes with an Apple computer, Microsoft Edge is provided with Windows, and if you have a Chromebook this will come with Google Chrome.
  - Most browsers are compatible with all systems. Just be sure to download the right version for your device.
- Have you already set up an account with Google, Microsoft, or Apple? 
  -  Each browser allows you to set up an account so that you can sync your browsing history and settings across multiple devices. 
  -  For example: if you are part of the Google Space you might consider Google Chrome as that will allow you to use your account to sync with your phone and access documents and services run through Google. 
-  Are you concerned about website tracking?
    -  Some browsers like Firefox have additional settings included that focus more on privacy and security. 
   -  Other browsers like Google Chrome may focus more on personalisation and customisation of content based on your interactions. 

If you choose to switch to another browser from your current one you will need to download and install it on to your computer. If you click on the links in the browser list above, or go to the application store or website of another browser that you wish to use you will be able to download and install the browsers from there.

### Installing the browser

To install a browser you can do this through a couple of methods depending on your device. 

**On Windows Computers**

You will need to use your default browser (Most likely Microsoft Edge) to navigate to the site of your desired browser. If you want to keep using Edge then you can skip this section.

Look for the **Download** button on the page. This will start the process of downloading the installer onto your computer to run and install the program.

Locate the new program icon from your Start Menu. When it asks you to set it as your default browser say YES.
