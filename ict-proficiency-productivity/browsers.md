# Installing and accessing browsers

## Overview 

Internet or web browsers are programs that you can use to navigate to and view content that exists on the internet. Where the internet is a network of digital webpages and content sitting in a database in a far away physical location, the browser is the interface that you, the user, will be using to display and access those webpages on your own computer. You are probably using one right now to view this article!

In this article we'll be looking at:

- Browser functionality
- Browser settings and customisation
- Add ons and tools

## Getting started

### What browser should I pick?

There are various types of browsers out there. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what type of computer operating system you have and what you might prefer in functionality, or if you are just picking on looks, there are a many choices out there. One of these will already come with whatever device that you have purchased.

Some of the more popular browers that you will encounter are:
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) 
  - Note: Only compatible with Apple devices, pre-installed on most Apple products. 
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Note: Already installed on new Windows computers and devices

Some considerations that you should make when choosing your browser would be:
- What operating system do you have on your computer? 
  - Safari usually comes with an Apple computer, Microsoft Edge is provided with Windows, and if you have a Chromebook this will come with Google Chrome.
  - Most browsers are compatible with all systems. Just be sure to download the right version for your device.
- Have you already set up an account with Google, Microsoft, or Apple? 
  -  Each browser allows you to set up an account so that you can sync your browsing history and settings across multiple devices. 
  -  For example: if you are part of the Google Space you might consider Google Chrome as that will allow you to use your account to sync with your phone and access documents and services run through Google. 
-  Are you concerned about website tracking?
    -  Some browsers like Firefox have additional settings included that focus more on privacy and security. 
   -  Other browsers like Google Chrome may focus more on personalisation and customisation of content based on your interactions.  
-  Do you have specific websites that you use that recommend a particular browser?
    -  Some websites are optimised for the browser with the largest usage share and will not function on other browsers.  It is worthwhile having a copy of [the most popular browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers) as a backup for these kinds of sites.


If you choose to switch to another browser from your current one you will need to download and install it on to your computer. If you click on the links in the browser list above, or go to the application store or website of another browser that you wish to use you will be able to download and install the browsers from there.

## Installing the browser

To install a browser you can do this through a couple of methods depending on your device. 

**On Windows Computers**

You will need to use your default browser (Most likely Microsoft Edge) to navigate to the site of your desired browser. If you want to keep using Edge then you can skip this section.

Look for the **Download** button on the page. This will start the process of downloading the installer onto your computer to run and install the program.

Locate the new program icon from your Start Menu. When it asks you to set it as your default browser say YES. 

**On Macs** (coming soon)

**On Android** (coming soon)

**On iOS** (coming soon)


## Browser functionality

The internet browser isn't just a program to display websites. Modern browsers can do a lot more when it comes to productivity, customisation, and personalisation. 

Some of the things a browser can do are:
- Navigate to a page on the [internet](https://aarnet.gitbook.io/digital-skills-gitbook-1/ict-proficiency-productivity/internet)
- Search the internet using a designated [search engine](https://aarnet.gitbook.io/digital-skills-gitbook-1/ict-proficiency-productivity/searchengines)
- [Bookmark](https://aarnet.gitbook.io/digital-skills-gitbook-1/ict-proficiency-productivity/bookmarks) and save locations on the internet to visit later
- Personalise and save settings between computers using the same browser*
- Share web pages between devices*
- Add on tools like password managers, citation tools, and colourblindness assistance

*These require a personal account set up with the browser

## Parts of your browser (Draft)

The browser has a lot of parts attached to it. Each of them work together to help you work with the complexities of the internet. When you think of a web page you might notice there's a lot of layers to it. The first part will be your browser or user interface. This is the browser's global navigation and will stick with you no matter where you go on the internet (Garsiel & Irish, 2011). 

### The Address Bar

This is where you will put the address of the website that you want so the browser knows what to bring back to you. 

The address bar also doubles as a search function. If you put in a search or some words instead of a web address it will use it's default search engine (Google, Bing etc.) to look up those words on the internet. 


### Navigation Buttons

These are located just to the left of your address bar. Usually you would have 3:
- Back 	&#8592;
- Forward &#8594;
- Refresh/Stop &#8635; 


### Browser Menu Options

In the top right you will find the browser menu indicated by the 3 dots.

In the browser menu you will find options to log into your account (if not located next to the menu), browsing history, saved bookmarks or favourited pages, browser customisation such as zooming or colour themes, add ons, and settings. 

### Bookmark Bar and Tool Bars



### Tabs and Windows

A lot of browsers will support having multiple **tabs** or pages open at the same time. You will find them all laid out across the top of your browser. To add a new one press the + icon at the end of the tab list or use the menu to open up a new tab. 

### Website Content

The main space of your browser will be made up of the content space. This is where your web page is displayed. Anything that falls inside this area will change depending on how the website is designed. Any buttons, links, text, and images is content from that website you have visited. All your browser is doing is displaying the content that website has delivered to you over the internet.
