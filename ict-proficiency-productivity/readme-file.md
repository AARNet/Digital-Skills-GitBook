## Overview 

A README file is a document that introduces and explains a project. 

## Developing

README files contain information about the other files in a directory or folder. The concept comes from programming but is also very useful for research projects.  It is usually a simple plain text file called README in capital letters. 

A good README includes information that helps the reader understand what the project is about.
