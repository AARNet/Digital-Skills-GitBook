# THE INTERNET

The Internet is a relatively informal world-wide communications network which allows messages and information to be sent from one computer to another through use of a modem, a machine that can can send and receive data over telephone lines.


# COMPUTER NETWORKS

A computer network is a group of two or more connected computing devices that communicate with one another. Networks can be used to share, exchange or communicate with other users electronically.

A Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers that are close together in one physical location.

## CABLE OR WI-FI?
 
Networks have physical properties.

Take a look at these websites that address some of the factors that affect network speeds:

* Time of day - https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/internet-landline-services/broadband-speeds (go to section 'Network limitations that affect speed')
* Physical interference - https://www.performancenetworks.co.uk/blog/post/5-factors-can-affect-wifi-signal/

Think of a standard network connection like rope where you unwind it and hand out each strand (as users log in). The more users, the less and less rope there is to hand out. Many laptops link to an access point on the network and that access point divides up the traffic to each laptop user. Even the placement of the cables can make a difference, as interference can come from different places, such as lifts and fans!

Many factors can influence the capacity of a wi-fi connection too. Can you think of any times when your wi-fi has become unstable?

# NETWORKS AND CONNECTIONS
 
Here is a list of different technologies used in Australia and New Zealand for connecting computers and the internet:
 
Each of these has different properties. 

## ADSL

A digital subscriber line (DSL) service provides a connection to the Internet through the telephone network. Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of DSL technology. In ADSL, bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater *toward* the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). ADSL2+ extends the capability of basic ADSL by doubling the number of downstream channels. The data rates can be as high as 24 Mbit/s downstream and up to 1.4 Mbit/s upstream. 

ADSL2+ service is most commonly offered in highly-populated metropolitan areas and subscribers must be in close geographical locations to the provider in order to receive ADSL2+. The further the subscriber is from the telephone exchange the slower the connection.

ADSL2+ has a maximum potential download speed of 24Mbps. Most ADSL2+ connections are much slower: the average Australian ADSL speed is just 8Mbps.

## NBN

The National Broadband Network (NBN) is an Australian national wholesale open-access data network project. It is a government initiative to upgrade Australia’s broadband infrastructure to provide consumers with faster broadband connections.

Using a variety of broadband network technologies including running fibre all the way to the consumer’s premises (‘fibre to the premises’ or FTTP), ir running fibre to a nearby box or apartment block and then using the existing copper telephone wire (‘fibre to the node’ or FTTN, and ‘fibre to the building’ or FTTB). The aim is to bring data closer to the end user on optical fibres. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with how close the delivery on fibre is to the end user.

NOTE: The main difference for the consumer between the NBN and ADSL is speed. There are various options for speed, depending on requirements.

## NREN
 
The Australian National Research Network (NREN) provides advanced research network infrastructure. It is *fast*, with connections from 10 Gbps to 40 and 100 Gbps. It is high capacity, catering to 1 million + users and is tailored for research, teaching and learning. It has low latency (lag) providing consistent connectivity and response times because it is designed to have ‘headroom’ or allow for bursts (elephants) of large data moving through the network. 
 
Australia is a large continent, and the networks AARNet provides enable data capture and research to be conducted in major cities and in regional areas, where universities and research facilities and infrastructure are located, e.g. the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in Murchison (WA).
 
Australia lies at a distance from research conducted in other parts of the world, like the northern hemisphere, and the networks AARNet provides aid in removing distance as a barrier to research collaboration.

#### *Remember!* 

**Headroom**: By capping utilization at less than link capacity, the AARNet network leaves room for latency sensitive traffic in order to avoid buffering and the associated large delays.
 
# Network speeds

We are now going to use a tool to better understand network speeds. One of the key factors in data movement is network speeds. These speeds can be affected by different issues, such as time of day and physical interference.

## Speed test

You can test the speed of your connection by using an app or a website. Let's try it!

### Activity 1
 
Test the speed of your connection by clicking on this link: [http://www.speedtest.net/](http://www.speedtest.net/)

Pay attention to upload vs download speeds. Check wi-fi, mobile phone and cable differences, either in the class or compare when you change your access type. 

Compare these speeds with what you learnt about different networks in the first part of the workshop. 

* Do they match up? 
* What would you consider a 'fast' connection? A 'slow' one?


### NBN evening speeds

Maximum speeds are not always available due to high traffic. This table shows 'evening speeds', which is what is expected at peak usage times between 7pm and midnight. 

Tier | Maximum speed | Evening speed
---- | ------------- | -------------
Basic (NBN 12) | 12Mbps | 7Mbps
Standard (NBN 25) | 25Mbps | 15Mbps
Standard Plus (NBN 50) | 50Mbps | 30Mbps
Premium (NBN 100) | 100Mbps | 60Mbps
---

### *Remember!*

The download and upload speeds of the domestic broadband speeds factor for more download than upload. That is, it is assumed that people download more than they upload.
