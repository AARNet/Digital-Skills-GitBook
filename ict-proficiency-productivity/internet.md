# Networks: the internet and how it works 

## Overview 

Most of us use the internet every day, but not all of us take the time to think about how it works. In fact, many of us will only notice when it doesn’t work. So what is the internet?  

This article will cover: 

- Networks and the internet 
- Measuring internet speeds 
- Uploads and downloads 
- Cable or wi-fi? 
- Networks and connections  

## Getting started 
 
### What is a network? 
 
In computing, a network comprises two or more devices that can communicate. A computer network is made up of a number of different computer systems connected by physical and/or wireless connections. The size of a network can range from a single home computer linked to other devices like a printer, to huge data centers that connect across the world, and to the whole of the Internet itself.  

All networks allow computers to share information and resources. 
 
### What is the internet? 

In simple terms, the internet can be defined as a group of interconnected networks. More specifically it is now the global network of computer networks using standard rules for how information is exchanged through the internet, also known as protocols.

### How does data move around the internet? 

A protocol is a set of rules that computers can follow to complete tasks. The Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) are the ones used by computers to communicate with each other.  These protocols were defined in 1980 and they are what helps the Internet to move data from one place to another. Data moving over the Internet is called “packet switching.” Packet switching sends data in separate pieces (these are the “packets”) which are tagged with your intended destination. 

In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new information management system at CERN. In 1991 it was launched as the World Wide Web (WWW, aka 'the web'). The Internet can be seen as the backbone of the web – what makes the web possible.  

Both hardware and software support the Internet. Types of hardware include routers, servers, phone towers, satellites, and smartphones. Types of software include browsers, such as Explorer or Chrome. Introduced in 1993 the browser made the internet and web available to a mass audience.
