# Collaboration, communication and participation

## Chapter overview

This chapter explores how we can use digital tools to build networks, influence social behaviours, to effectively **share** and **participate** in digital spaces.  

Topics included are:

- **digital media, tools or platforms** for communicating and working with others, both in our immediate workplace and beyond; 
- skills and understandings of **how to communicate effectively and build networks** online;   
- practising ourselves and helping others to collaborate and **participate in digital spaces across cultural, social and linguistic boundaries**.

The scaffolded skills approach for each of these tools and understandings enables all who engage an opportunity to learn whether you are a novice or expert.
