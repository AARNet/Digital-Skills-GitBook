# Introduction to Markdown
 
Markdown is how you can make rich (or formatted) text in a plain text editor.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. An example of a markup language is HTML. You can use Markdown in different text editors and environments (such as GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks) to create rich text with plain text. 
 
Let's start with some basic markdown. 
 
## Headings
 
To create a heading in Markdown you use a hash and a space before the words in the heading:
 
`# Introduction to Markdown`

 This will look like 
 
 # Introduction to Markdown
 
 when the heading is rendered, or changed to rich text, by the text editor or the environment you are writing in.
 
 Now let's add a subheading. This time you use two hashtags before the words in your subheading
  
`## A lesson in Markdown`
 
  - Click on 'Run' - the button with the triangle next to a vertical line (it looks like a 'play' icon) or use the shortcut Shift+Enter to execute the cell. You now have a subheading.
  
  Body text
 
 To write in your notebook in normal body text, you just have to type your text in the Markdown cell and press 'Run' or use the shortcut Shift+Enter.
 
  - Type
  
This is my first lesson in Markdown. 
 
 - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut Shift+Enter.
 
  You can now type your comments in your Jupyter Notebook.
  
  Editing a cell
  
 Let's say we want to add some text to the cell you executed above. Double-click on that line and you can open up the cell again.
  
   -  After the first sentence, type
   
I'm doing really well! 
  
 If you want to add a new cell you can click on the 'up arrow' icon from the buttons above.  To delete or edit a cell, you can toggle up and down the cells.
 
 Adding a new cell
 
 Let's add a new cell. Under your subheading, you can add another heading. Go to your subheading 'A lesson in Markdown' and click on the 'plus' button. This will create a new cell. Select 'Markdown' from the drop-down menu.
 
 - Type
 
### Use it to create rich text in a plain text editor 
 
 - Press 'Run' or use the shortcut Shift+Enter.
 
 You now have a level three heading.
 
Bold
 
Now let's try bold font. In a new cell, select 'Markdown' from the drop-down menu again.
 
 - Type
  
This is **really** interesting.
  
  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut Shift+Enter to execute the cell.
  - Voilà! Bold!
 
 Italics
 
Now let's try italics. In a new cell, select 'Markdown' from the drop-down menu again.
 
 - Type
  
This is really _interesting_.
     
  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut Shift+Enter to execute the cell.
  - Voilà! Italics!
 
Activity - Practising with Markdown
 
Spend a couple of minutes practising these skills: Headings, plain/bold/italics text, adding, removing, and editing cells.
 
It can feel a little strange, as you already know how to do formatting in programs like Word. However, what we are doing here is 'speaking' directly to the computer, with a different kind of interface so you can also perform calculations, visualisations and use computational methods. Remember that the reason Jupyter Notebooks is becoming so popular is because it is a format that allows for commenting and text to sit within the same 'document' as code, mathematical equations, and visualisations. You can tell the story of what you are doing as you go, and this is a useful way of being about to reproduce your results.
