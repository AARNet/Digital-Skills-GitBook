# Digital Skills GitBook

The Digital Skills GitBook is a living, open source online guide to 'modern not-quite-technical computer skills' for researchers and the broader academic community.

A collaboration between Australia's Academic Research Network (AARNet) and the Council of Australian Librarians (CAUL), this book is the creation of the CAUL Digital Dexterity Champions and their communities.
